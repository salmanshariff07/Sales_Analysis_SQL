# Sales_Analysis_SQL_Project
This project is based on a practical SQL case study provided by Northwind, a fictional company commonly used in sample databases for learning and demonstration purposes. I was given a backup file (NORTHWIND.bak) containing the full database, along with a list of real-world business scenarios to solve.

üõ†Ô∏è Initial Setup
The first step involved restoring the NORTHWIND.bak file into Microsoft SQL Server. Once the database was successfully restored, I used Microsoft Excel as a powerful companion tool to interact with the data. By using Excel‚Äôs ‚ÄúGet Data from SQL Server‚Äù feature, I was able to directly connect to the database and pull in sample data.

Instead of importing entire tables, I used the Advanced SQL Query option within Excel to selectively import the top 100 rows from each table. This allowed for a quick preview and helped maintain performance while exploring the structure and content of the database.

üîç Understanding the Data
With the sample data in Excel, I focused on understanding how the different tables are connected‚Äîespecially by identifying foreign key relationships (i.e., how one table links to another). This step was crucial in visualizing the database as a whole and understanding how data flows across various entities such as customers, orders, products, and employees.

Excel‚Äôs tabular layout made it easier to analyze and compare data, perform quick lookups, and test out initial logic before writing more complex queries. It essentially became a sandbox for testing and validating insights.

‚úÖ Solving the Scenarios
Once I had a solid understanding of the database structure and relationships, I began addressing the specific scenarios provided by Northwind. These scenarios involved writing SQL queries to extract insights, generate reports, and simulate typical business use cases (e.g., identifying top customers, calculating revenue, tracking order patterns, etc.).

I organized each solution step-by-step, breaking down complex queries into understandable parts. This helped in ensuring that each requirement was met clearly and accurately. The final outputs align closely with the expectations laid out in the original scenario brief.

This project not only strengthened my technical SQL skills but also helped improve my problem-solving approach‚Äîespecially in working with real-world datasets, understanding relational models, and using tools like Excel to streamline the data analysis process.
